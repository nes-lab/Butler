	Usage (in a nutshell):
	
		* declare resources with GPI_RESOURCE_DECLARE(<type> [, <numbers>]);
		
		* reserve resources with GPI_RESOURCE_RESERVE(<type> [, <numbers>]);
		
		* if a resource is used by multiple partners, reserve it with GPI_RESOURCE_RESERVE_SHARED()
		  (instead of GPI_RESOURCE_RESERVE()) at each partner
		  
		* Syntactically, <type> must be a valid identifier. <numbers> is a comma-separated list of
		  up to five numbers. If <numbers> is provided, then it holds:
		  
			* preprocessor macros in <numbers> are expanded
			
			* each <number> must resolve to a literal number that can be part of an identifier
			  (may be relaxed in the future)

	Background

	Basic idea: Each software module marks used (occupied) hardware resources. Based on these 
	markers, automatic checks ensure that there are no resource conflicts between different 
	software modules. Specifically,	if two or more modules mark the same resource, the check 
	generates some kind of error (e.g. compilation error, linker error, runtime assertion).

	To avoid undetected conflicts due to typos, existing resources should be explicitly declared.
	Resources are identified by the combination of <type> and up to five <numbers>, where <numbers>
	can be left out if <type> provides a unique identification on its own. The separate handling
	of <type> and <numbers> (instead of just writing <type>_<numbers>) enables macro expansion
	on <numbers>, which has some advantages in practice.

	Deciding about what is a single resource, i.e. the granularity of declarations, is a difficult 
	issue in general. Coarse declarations hinder usage of subcomponents in different modules, 
	while fine-grained declarations hardly cover higher-level dependencies. For example, think
	of a hardware timer unit with multiple capture/compare (CC) blocks. Defining the whole timer 
	as one resource hinders usage of individual CC blocks in different modules. On the other hand, 
	defining the CC blocks as individual resources hides the fact that all of them depend on the
	same counter, prescaler, etc.

	GPI_RESOURCE_RESERVE_SHARED() can be used to handle such interrelations in a smart way.
	The macro allows to mark a resource in multiple modules, but triggers an error if the same
	resource is marked as non-SHARED in any module. Semantically, GPI_RESOURCE_RESERVE_SHARED
	should express that the specific usage of the resource is compatible with the usage of the
	same resource at other places where it has been reserved SHARED (it states that other uses
	are explicitly considered). 
	With this definition in mind, the timer example could be handled as follows:
	* Declare resources for both, the timer as a whole and the CC blocks.
	* Reserve CC blocks with GPI_RESOURCE_RESERVE(), i.e. non-SHARED.
	* Additionally, reserve the timer with GPI_RESOURCE_RESERVE_SHARED().
	The last point implies that it has been checked that all places where the timer is used do
	not disturb each other. If anybody adds a new software module and tries to reserve the same
	timer with GPI_RESOURCE_RESERVE(), then an error appears, telling the author that the timer
	is already in use. The author can then check if the new module uses the timer in a compatible
	way. If so, she can replace GPI_RESOURCE_RESERVE by GPI_RESOURCE_RESERVE_SHARED in the new 
	module, otherwise she must not use this timer instance.

// resource reservation commands

// Resource instances are identified by the combination of a type and up to five numbers.
// The numbers are optional at the public interface. Internally we add X zeros to the argument
// list, which effectively provides a default value of 0 for the first X numbers.
// (Maybe this feature becomes important for future enhancements.)
// The following macros implement the default values and combine the type and all numbers
// into one composite identifier for each resource.

// ATTENTION: The most simple implementation is
//
//		#define GPI_RESOURCE_<operation>(...)	_GPI_RESOURCE_<operation>(__VA_ARGS__, 0)
//
// This variant has a significant drawback: If one of the arguments matches a macro name,
// then this macro gets expanded in the intermediate step. This is a critical issue because
// it is not unlikely that chosen type names interfere with definitions from other
// hardware-related header files (e.g. CMSIS <device.h> in case of ARM-based platforms).
// Indeed, using the same names may be intentional.
// For this reason, we use the following concept, which avoids macro expansion:
//
//		#define GPI_RESOURCE_<operation>(...)	_HELPER(dummy, ## __VA_ARGS__, 0)
//		#define _HELPER(dummy, a1, a2, ...)		_GPI_RESOURCE_<operation>(_ ## a1, a2)
//
// Here, the concatenation operator avoids macro expansion. Note that it is used in a very
// special (and GNU specific) way in the first line, and it decorates a1 with a preceding
// underscore in the second line (which is not critical in our use case).
// Instead of wasting the dummy argument, we use it to select the operation, which finally
// leads to the code below. Note how _GPI_RESOURCE_X5() "dynamically" assembles a macro call,
// which gets evaluated by successive macro expansion.
